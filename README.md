## COVID-19 INDIA DATA ANALYSIS AND TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING MODEL (REGRESSION MODEL) TO PREDICT CASES IN UPCOMING DAYS
In this project, I had trained a Regression Model to predict Daily Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 in India. Data used is between 30 January 2020 to 22 June 2020.
### Task - 1 : Data analyzing of data available
* It include removing unnecessary features from the data.
* Splitting the data into train set, dev set, test set in 80-10-10 ratio.
Train set : 30 January 2020 to 23 May 2020 (115 days).
Train set : 24 May 2020 to 7 June 2020 (15 days).
Train set : 8 June 2020 to 22 June 2020 (15 days).
### Task - 2 : Training Model with Normal Equation method.
* It includes training of model on train set.
* Finding the best polynomial function to use as hypothesis with the help of dev set.
* Regularization parameter tuning with the help of dev set.
### Task - 3 : Conclusion.
* Finding the accuracy on test set.
* Creating a bar to input date to predict, daily confirmed case on that day.
